title=About JavaChess
byLine=by Jia Jie
body=JavaChess is an online realtime chess app made with Java. It features a realtime chat, reviewing past games \
  and multiple beautiful themes. \n\n\
  The frontend is made using JavaFX and communicates with the server using spring websocket client and retrofit2. \
  The backend is a spring boot server with websockets, and authenticates with the frontend using JWTs. Overall, \
  developing this app with such an unconventional tech stack was an interesting experience and I learned a lot. \n\n\
